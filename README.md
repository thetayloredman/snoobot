## Officially Supported Node Versions

You are welcome to use whatever Node.js version you would like, however, this package has a limited support range.

We always support the latest LTS release. We _try_ to support Maintenance versions, however it is not guaranteed. Once a version reaches EOL, we will no longer support it.
